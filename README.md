the CLUE version
===============================
You've been invited to a dinner party with 5 strangers at Mr. Boddy's house.
Before the festivities begin, Mr. Boddy is murdered by one of his guests.
Collect clues and escape from the house to ensure your safety and identify the killer.

Click on a pawn to select your player.

Use the 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right' keys to move the player across the floor

Collect the clue cards on your way out of the house
The more clue cards you collect, the more likely you are to ID the killer when you escape

Avoid the weapons! (rope, knife, candlestick, lead pipe, wrench, revolver)
If a weapon hits you, you drop all collected clues and return to the initial position
